**Give a voice to your loved ones with SpeakEasy AAC.**

SpeakEasy AAC is a simple, fully customizable Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app designed to help individuals who have difficulty speaking communicate effectively. Whether for a toddler learning their first words, a non-verbal child with Autism, or an adult recovering from a stroke, SpeakEasy provides a clean, distraction-free interface to express needs and thoughts.

Unlike expensive communication devices or complex apps, SpeakEasy is designed to be **intuitive, offline, and completely private.**

✨ **KEY FEATURES**

**📸 Fully Customizable Cards**
Create your own communication cards in seconds. Use the camera to take pictures of real objects (like a favorite toy or specific food), or upload images from your gallery. Visual recognition is easier when using familiar photos!

**mic 🎙️ Record Familiar Voices**
While we offer built-in Text-to-Speech, nothing beats a familiar voice. Parents or caregivers can record audio for any card. When the user taps the card, they hear *your* recording—perfect for emotional connection and recognizing family members.
